Time Series Forecasting of Active Customers Using Sequence Models: A Comparative Evaluation 

Abstract

Active customer forecasting is vital for software-as-a-service companies to effectively plan and allocate resources and gain data-driven insights into customer dynamics in the firm. This study presents a comprehensive comparative benchmark of sequence modeling on forecasting approaches for predicting active customer accounts on a real-world dataset. Advanced hybrid recurrent and convolutional neural networks are evaluated against Facebook Prophet models. The aim is to investigate the capabilities and limitations of diverse modeling techniques tailored to customer time series data and evaluate predictive accuracy for forecasting future active accounts and provide insights to guide model selection. The research employs both multivariate and univariate time series analysis, using Long Short-Term Memory networks, 1D Convolutional Neural Networks, and Facebook Prophet models. A rigorous preprocessing pipeline ensures data integrity. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization configures robust models. The multivariate LSTM-Conv1D model achieves superior performance, attaining a test mean absolute error of 16.49 and R-squared of 0.84. It significantly outperforms Prophet models constrained by linear assumptions and also does better than univariate LSTM-Conv1D. The hybrid deep learning architecture benefits from incorporating multiple related time series and modeling their complex spatiotemporal interactions. The experiments quantify up to 96.62% improvement in accuracy versus Prophet as baseline model, demonstrating deep learning's advantages for capturing intricate customer dynamics. This methodology and empirical analysis contribute valuable practical guidelines and highlight effective nonlinear time series modeling strategies using sophisticated neural network architectures. The results advance active customer forecasting capabilities to strengthen data-driven decision-making for customer relationship management software-as-a-service companies.
